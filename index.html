            <h2>My First Grand Project: The Classic Tic Tac Toe</h2>
            <p>
                Dive into a timeless battle of X's and O's. This game was a fundamental exploration
                of interactive web design and basic game logic. It's surprisingly intricate
                despite its simple appearance.

        <div class="project-card">
            <h2>Dots and Boxes: Think, Connect, Conquer</h2>
            <p>
                A game of strategy and foresight. Connect the dots, complete boxes, and outsmart your opponent.
                Featuring multiple AI difficulty levels and responsive feedback â€” this was a major leap in logic design.
